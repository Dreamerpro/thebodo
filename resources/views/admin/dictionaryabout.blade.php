                <h3><u>Why need contribution?</u></h3>
                <p >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base English database has more than 176023 words but not all of them are necessary. Even though if 10% words are not necessary, that leaves 158420 approx. words to be translated and if it takes 2 min at minimum to translate each word, it will take  158420*2= 316840 min =5281 hrs.= 220 days = 7.33 months continuously. So for single person it's not possible within less than a year but with the help of all of you guys it's just a work of few minutes.  <br><hr></p> 
                 <h3><u>Where can it be used?</u></h3>
                 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this dictionary database generation completes then I'll be able to create an android dictionary app using it. But this is not all. My target is to use it, in as many areas as possible . I'm Co-founder of `ThinkMerit`, an online education platform. With this we are trying to provide free education to all the students accross the country. By free education we mean, study materials(notes + question bank) and many tools to track progress, improve, guide and excel in each subject. Currently this product is in development mode and will be available in 2nd quarter of 2017. Many students from different IIT, NIT, IIIT, DU and many other reputed colleges are working with us in developing the content to make concepts easily understandable for everyone. Here is where I will need the database generated. For different Indian languages like Hindi, Bangla, Punjabi, Marathi and many more will have the advantage to translate the content using Google Translate but unfortunately that is not available for our language Bodo. Like this, there are many areas where it can be usefull or if anyone wants the database to build something to help our community that is also possible . At last, I would like to request if anyone of you can contribute in making this database, please sign up <a href="/register">here</a> and wait for me to make you admin, after that further instructions will be provided. <i>The contributor's name will be automatically recorded for each contribution even for one word.</i></p>
                <h3><u>Why need admin account to contribute?</u></h3>
                <p>To prevent possible spam.</p>
